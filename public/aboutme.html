        <p id="lahore">Hi, my name is Taimoor and I am originally from pakistan but currently residing in Dallas,TX.
                I recently graduated from <br /> The University of Texas at Austin in BS chemistry
                and currently pursuing my dream of becoming a software developer.<br /> I enjoy working with new technologies and
                improving my programming skills to match the current requirements in<br /> the Tech industry.
                I love playing soccer and reading Biographies of prominent Politicians and Economists to see what<br /> their experiences can tell us about the future.
                If you want to know more about what i think about current/old politicians<br /> and their policies, you can read my <b>Blog!!!</b> I started coding when 
                I was 20 years old and it was one of the best decisions<br /> of my life because I genuinly love what I do. Quickest way to start a conversation with 
                me is to ask me what city I was<br /> born in, and I will instantly start talking about Lahore and how amazing it is!
